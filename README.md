# Week 6 Video 1 my thoughts

Awesome intro and welcome! Like you mentioned about the auto save I never found the video or if Professor Todd even talked about it but it sure is a lot better than having to remember to save every time. Autosave is definitley the way to go. One thing I noticed recentley is that when I try to commit on gitbash it brings me back to VSCODE to have me write my commit message. I like using git bash but using the "source control" option on left side above the debugger has been easy. It shows me a summary of changes or modifications I made, new folders or files I created that is going to be eventually pushed to github. I am however intrested in using the built in terminal you mentioned to add to my knowledge and use it to push to github. After messing with the terminal for a bit if you click on the + sign down arrow you select the option "select default profile" that will bring up a list which you can choose bash as a default. My curiosity started when in your video the bash logo had a different look than mine and I was jealous lol. Figured that out too, THANKS!
