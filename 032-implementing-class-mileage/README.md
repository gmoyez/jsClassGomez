# Week 13 Implement Class Mileage

Class could be implemented possible in the render.js. Using it for the table, edit buttons and so on. Maybe even handle.js with iformvali, trackcotandmpg, calculateavg. Dont have an idea where to start but those are some ideas.

## Where would you implement trip class

## what broke and how can we fix it?

My edit button broke, throws erroe message on console. My average and tip output dont show up like normal. just "NaN". Delete worked fine, submit as well. Those are the ones i caught.
