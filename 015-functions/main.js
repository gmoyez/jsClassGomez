/*  Its pretty cool that we learned both ways to look at funtions.
    Knowing both is necessary to have a good understanding of JavaScript.
    Both were fun to work with although we went through arrow 
    functions a lot faster its cleaner and easier to learn. Yes I brackets but I could get used to 
    syntax sugar.
    After looking up Syntactic sugar, it is designed to make code easier to read. Oh yeah, I definitley like it.
