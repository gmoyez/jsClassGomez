# Week #11 Local storage

## First Assignment

This assignment was pretty intresting. I had been hearing of JSON but never really looked into it and its used in vscode like in settings i believe. In my attempt i sorta figured it had to do with "My_Data" but i never guessed it was needed more than once. Overall liked this assignment. My questions were answered towards the end with why the need to store data and recall it.
