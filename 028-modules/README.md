# Week #11

After going through this lesson you can tell that modularizing makes it look much cleaner. I dont have a background in coding but like you mentioned it could be much cleaner im not sure what else. I always thought wow look at all those lines of code but much perfer the module look in different sections. Import and export is pretty cool something new for me.
