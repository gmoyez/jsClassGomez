# Week #9 More Refactoring

Pretty sweet what you have done with the mileage program making be able to edit and delete lines. A CRUD app that comes to mind right away now that you mentioned how i would be able to use in my everyday would be something like a to-do list. Not only for school but for my job duties as spray supervisor overseeing areas in the nursery that need to be sprayed. More ideas might come up but that was the first one. Im still playing catch up its been a weird semester but im powering throught everthing as much as possible.
