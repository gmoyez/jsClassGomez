#Week 7

#Are you using devTools

Thats a big YES! from me. I had seen that before just messing around in webpages but i never really understood it until this class. What the buttons are for how can they be used to look are your code plus any webpage code on the web. Really useful when debugging and looking at specifically which line of code is causing trouble. Moving forward im going to make it a habbit of using in programming as i move forward. Another tool for the utility belt. Thanks! 

I was not able to fix the issues not because i had no idea there was issues. I was coding along and having fun with the arrays but idnt notice the DOM wasnt updating. Or the mileage rounding up, that one was new to me. I should be paying close attention and coding along with detail. 

Another thing I picked up from using DevTools is applying breakpoints to lines of code so that i can pause code from running and check lines of code and have a better understand of that plus learning to look at the call stack to see were i am specifically.  

#Feedback
Not going to lie I had an off week, its was a super busy week at work and thats why Im on week 8 working on week 7 work lol. Overall though happy with learning arrays and loops. My favorite has to be the end though. Seeing how you cleaned up the code made it easir for me to read but also opens my eyes to seeing different possibilities in multiple ways to write code. Im for sure going to continue practicing to get a better grasp of concepts and how they work.
