# Week #12 - DOM selectors

## Fix my code

## Which DOM selector and where would the code go

Would it be "getElementsByTagName" and possible update the render.js to have that code updated or inserted since thats were the button functions are at. Also thinking it might be "querySelectorAll" as you can select them all so they can be disabled while only one is in use.
