#Are you using devTools

Thats a big YES! from me. I had seen that before just messing around in webpages but i never really understood it until this class. What the buttons are for how can they be used to look are your code plus any webpage code on the web. Really useful when debugging and looking at specifically which line of code is causing trouble. Moving forward im going to make it a habbit of using in programming as i move forward. Another tool for the utility belt. Thanks!
