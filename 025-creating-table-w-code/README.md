# Week #9 Creating Table with Code

## First Assignmnet

I think both ways must serve a purpose but i do think that the "function" make s it look cleaner especially if i want or need to refactor.

## Where in code do we start to render the table

I would say in the "main.js" file but more specifically I wouldnt know. If I had to guess I would say in the same area as the error message.

## How would we render the tr (table rows)

I would say in the same area as similar to "renderTable" but like renderTr or something in order to get the rows.
