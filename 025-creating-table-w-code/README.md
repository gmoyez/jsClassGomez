# Week #9 Creating Table with Code

## First Assignmnet

I think both ways must serve a purpose but i do think that the "function" make s it look cleaner especially if i want or need to refactor.

## Where in code do we start to render the table

I would say in the "main.js" file but more specifically I wouldnt know. If I had to guess I would say in the same area as the error message.

## How would we render the tr (table rows)

I would say in the same area as similar to "renderTable" but like renderTr or something in order to get the rows.

## Information on table doesnt line up

Probably rearrange order so that the information matches the headings on the table.

## how can we fix the rendering table issues at the end of first assignment of week 10?

Not exactly sure to fix the rendering issue. Would say probably in the form area of the code but again unsure. 

## final

my only question would be why not keep the button function together with output of the button together. In the middle we have renderTable function could i refactor and group together.
