# Week #12 - Higher order functions

Nice video! Honestly. Going to be watching all 10 javascript ones when i get a chance. From my understanding the higher order functions allow you to simply you r code and do more with less code. Keeping things simple by not repeating yourself and being able to modulerize. Like he said it takes a function as a parameter or returns a fuction. I liked that he used array.filter as and example and showed the different ways to get the same results. Even the arrow functions. Subscribing!
